First let me say that when I say \\\"intelligent\\\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit's environment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neurotic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production \\nbecause it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaurus, it's activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiosity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary\\n-- \\nGary Coffman KE4TV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4tv!gary\\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!social!ke4tv!gary\\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4tv!gary \\nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \\n\",\n          \"From: jake@westminster.ac.uk (Shazad Barlas)\\nSubject: Re: Thoughts on the VW Corrado VR6\\nKeywords: VW Corrado\\nOrganization: University of Westminster\\nLines: 8\\n\\nIn the EC, the Corrado VR6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a \\n968'.
